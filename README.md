# My Sublime Text 3 configuration

You'll find my personnal Sublime Text 3 configuration in this repository.

## Installed packages

- AdvancedNewFile
- Character Table
- Emmett
- SideBarEnhancements
- Theme - Soda

## Color scheme

My color scheme is based off Peacock. I just modified the comments color because, in my opinion, it's important to distinguish comments from basic text.

## Keymaps

`CMD+N` is mapped to AdvancedNewFile. Opening a new tab is done with `CMD+ALT+TAB`.
